# About

Hello! My name is Saibal De, and I am a 5th year PhD student at the [Department
of Mathematics, University of Michigan](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/). My
advisors are [Dr. Shravan Veerapaneni](http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~shravan/)
and [Dr. Xun Huan](http://rxhuan.com/).

I obtained my Four Year Bachelor of Science (Research) degree in Mathematics
(with a minor in Physics) from [Indian Institute of Science
(Bangalore)](https://iisc.ac.in/) in 2016.

I was a co-organizer for the [Directed Reading
Program](https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/drp) at the Department of
Mathematics, University of Michigan from Fall 2019 to Fall 2020. During Fall
2018 and Winter 2019 semesters, I co-hosted the [Student Machine Learning
Seminar](http://dept.math.lsa.umich.edu/seminars_events/events.php?eventdefid=98)
with [Rishi Sonthalia](https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/rsonthal/).

# Research Interests

Physics-based simulations in general produce superior quality simulation
outputs. But due to their high computational costs, they cannot be deployed
widely in practice for learning tasks such as optimization or control. In my
research, I use

*   Novel fast algorithms (integral equations, tensor factorizations)
*   High-performance computing frameworks
*   Novel computing paradigms (quantum computing)

to accelerate and scale up these high-fidelity simulations. Recently, I have
also started exploring data-driven reduced-order modeling frameworks, utilizing

*   Tensor-train decomposition
*   Bayesian inference

to generate surrogate models for time-critical learning applications.

Here is a link to my [CV]({{ '/assets/pdf/curriculum-vitae.pdf' | prepend:
